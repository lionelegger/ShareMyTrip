<h2 id="whatissharemytrip">What is ShareMyTrip?</h2>

<p>ShareMyTrip is a website that helps travellers to plan, map and budget a trip. When you travel alone, everything is easy&#8230; But what happens when you travel with friends, share bills? Sometimes you pay for all your friends, organize excursion only with a subgroup of friends or buy yourself a souvenir&#8230; It can very quickly be a complex task to calculate the trip expenses. ShareMyTrip makes travelling together easy and facilitate all expenses calculation. It helps you to plan, manage and visualize your future trips. </p>

<h2 id="howtousethewebsite">How to use the website</h2>

<p>When you arrive to the homepage, the first thing you need to do is to login or register as a new user. The password is encrypted. If you register, you are automatically logged in.
Once you are logged in, you arrive on the trip page. Once logged, you can always change your personal information by clicking on your avatar </p>

<h3 id="profilepage">Profile page</h3>

<p>This page allows you to modify your personal information, as well as to change your avatar picture or even upload another one (300px by 300px). The changes will be visible only after logout and login again. </p>

<h3 id="trippage">Trip page</h3>

<p>This page is the first one a new user sees when he logs in. A welcome message indicate the 3 main steps he should do: &#8220;Add a trip&#8221;, &#8220;Add users&#8221; and &#8220;Add actions&#8221;. In the beginning, only the &#8220;Add a trip&#8221; option is available.
* Add trip: This will add a new trip. The currency defines which currency will be used for the current trip. If you plan to manage most of your expenses in the foreign currency, then define it here. NB: The currency functionality is saved but yet no currency rate has been implemented yet. The dates are not mandatory if they are not known yet. You can always change the trip setting by clicking on the &#8220;settings&#8221; button on the top right corner of the trip box.
* Add user: You can choose to travel alone or with friends. If you travel with friends, click on &#8220;Add a user&#8221;, otherwise, you can directly &#8220;Plan this trip&#8221;. </p>

<h3 id="planpage">Plan page</h3>

<p>The plan page gives you an overview of all trip actions organised by date. You can also easily see which action is not paid, partially paid or full paid thanks to the action color codes. </p>

<p>If you want to share a trip with someone else, this latter should have an user registered in the system. You can add a new user to a trip using his email.</p>

<h2 id="websitearchitecture">Website Architecture</h2>

<p>ShareMyTrip website is based on <strong>Model-View-Controller</strong> (MVC) software design pattern.
* The Database is a <strong>MySql database</strong> managed by <strong><a href="https://cakephp.org/">cakePHP</a></strong>, a php framework. .
* The controller is managed with <strong>cakePHP</strong> too. This latter provides JSON feeds to the views.
* The views are html5/css3 with a layer of angularJS. AngularJS send JSON requests to the controller and updates the view in consequence. </p>

<h3 id="model">Model</h3>

<p>The Database contains 9 tables (illustrated in this <a href="/files/ShareMyTrip-DB.pdf">pdf</a>) organised around 3 main tables:
1. <strong>users</strong>: This table is the core of the DB. In order to use the website, you need first to login or create a user account. This latter has an <em>email</em>, <em>first name</em> and <em>last name</em>, as well as a <em>password</em> and an <em>avatar</em> image. Since a user can participate to several trips (or actions) and a trip (or action) can contain several users, a junction table &#8216;MANY to MANY&#8217; exists to link trips (or actions) to users:
 + trips_users: This table records all users that belong to a specific trip. When creating a trip, the owner is registered as the only participant of the trip. Then, he can add other users to participate to his trip.
 + actions_users: Each action can be performed by 1 (at least) to all participants of the trip (proposed by default in the view).
2. <strong>trips</strong>: A trip will be created only a few times. A trip has a specific <em>name</em>. It also has a preferred <em>currency</em>, depending if the user wants to use the local currency or its own currency. The trip creator is the only one that can edit the trip settings and thus, a <em>owner_id</em> property is defined for each trip. Finally, it has a <em>starting</em> and <em>ending</em> date, that is not necessarily the first and last dates of its actions.
3. <strong>actions</strong>: The actions will be the most often updated table with most fields. Many actions will be created for a specific trip. Each action has its type, owner and name (required properties). All other properties are not mandatory, like action information (company, reservation, identifier, note). Each action can have a price and a currency. Finally, each action can also have a starting and ending <em>datetime</em>, <em>name</em>, <em>longitude</em> and <em>latitude</em><br/>
 + <strong>payments</strong>: An action can be paid in several payments. All payments <em>amounts</em> are stored in this table that also provides the <em>payment method</em>, <em>currency</em> and <em>date</em> information.
 + Each payment can be done with a specific payment method (table <strong>methods</strong>)
 + <strong>types</strong>: Each action belongs to a specific type. A typical type would be Plane, Boat, Hotel, Bank, etc&#8230;
 + each type belongs to a specific category (table <strong>categories</strong>). In order not to have too many types, these latter are categorised in 4 categories: Travel, Lodging, Activity, Other</p>

<h3 id="prototyping">Prototyping</h3>

<p>The prototype has been first created on paper and tested on several users. The user interface has been validated with a 3 steps process:
 1. A paper prototype for the first ideas and tests
 2. An interactive prototype (available in <a href="/files/ShareMyTrip.pdf">pdf</a>) to test the desktop and mobile versions
 3. A final test directly on the website for minor adjustments</p>

<h3 id="responsiveness">Responsiveness</h3>

<p>Since this website is supposed to help travellers to manage their travel in all stages and any environment, it was important that it is working as well for desktop (for trip planification) and for mobile devices (for easy and fast trip updates and consultation). Thus, <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">bootsrap</a> has been used as a base html/css/js framework for responsive design. </p>
